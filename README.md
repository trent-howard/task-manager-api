## Task Manager API

This is just a simple project made with the goal of learning Node.js and backend service development.

It implements some RESTful API calls which can be used to manage users, sessions, and tasks.

Throughout the course of the project I gained some exposure to

* Express.js
* Creating middleware for Express
* Jason Web Tokens (JWT)
* Mongo DB and the Mongoose CDM
* Jest

This project was a great opportunity to learn how to use promises and async/await patterns.
